  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm glad you're here — thanks for visiting my website :heart_hands:

I am a skilled product leader with over 15 years of experience doing a combination of product management, data science, machine learning, and software development. 

You might already be familiar with my open-source development work: I was the first PM of Data Science Communication @RStudio, where I significantly upgraded the R Markdown user experience (an ecosystem of >15 software packages with ~40k daily downloads). I made [tidymodels.org](https://tidymodels.org) and other widely used "websites as welcome mats" (reaching >100k users per week), developed [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) (>32k code mentions on GitHub since 2020), wrote the book on building websites with R Markdown, and have delivered technical keynote talks across the globe – in Australia, Canada, Latin America, and the U.S.
